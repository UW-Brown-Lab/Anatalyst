Notes on how modules should work:
 -  Define inputs and outputs
 -  idea: For workflow-type pipelines, there should be a persistent data object that keeps getting updated
        - Optionally, output for specific steps could also be saved (mem management?)
 -  Should these modules input/outputs optionally be overwritable? Or is this overengineering...

Plotting:
 -  Plotting with this modular flow remains a challenge...
 -  Perhaps write to a consistent key in DataContext such as "plotting", 
    appending a structured Title, Caption, Graphic structure, eventually stitched together by some plotting module?
