Notes on how modules should work:
 -  Define inputs and outputs
 -  idea: For workflow-type pipelines, there should be a persistent data object that keeps getting updated
        - Optionally, output for specific steps could also be saved (mem management?)
 -  Should these modules input/outputs optionally be overwritable? Or is this overengineering...

Module Parameter validation
 -  It feels like this should be validated before pipeline execution... perhaps this should be refactored to the config parser?
 -  Tabling this for now because it feels like a lower prio issue.
